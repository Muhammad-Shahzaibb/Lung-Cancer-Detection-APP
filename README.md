# Lung-Cancer-Detection-APP


●	Introduction

The primary aim of this project is to develop a machine learning application for the early detection of lung cancer using demographic and lifestyle features. The motivation behind this endeavor is to enhance treatment outcomes and increase patient survival rates by identifying individuals at high risk of developing lung cancer at an early stage. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we strive to provide healthcare professionals with a tool to proactively manage and monitor lung cancer risks.

●	Solution Design

             The solution involves rigorous data preprocessing to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and remove outliers. Subsequently, machine learning models, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), are implemented and optimized using GridSearchCV to achieve optimal predictive accuracy. The selected Random Forest Classifier is integrated into a Streamlit application for real-time predictions.

●	Implementation & Testing

             Implementation involves leveraging Python and relevant libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and Streamlit for web application development. Rigorous testing using cross-validation techniques and performance metrics ensures the models' effectiveness. The integrated Streamlit application enables users to input their demographic and lifestyle information, obtain risk predictions, and visualize the results seamlessly.

●	Conclusion

             In conclusion, the development of a machine learning application for early lung cancer detection holds immense promise in augmenting public health efforts. By amalgamating predictive modeling techniques with user-friendly interfaces, this application empowers healthcare professionals and individuals to proactively manage lung cancer risks. Further refinement and validation are imperative to ensure the application's efficacy and applicability in real-world clinical settings.
